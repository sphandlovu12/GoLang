URL Shortener:

Project Description: Creating a simple URL shortener application in Go. A URL shortener takes long URLs and converts them into shorter, more manageable versions.

Steps to Build:

Set up a Go development environment if you haven't already.
Create a new Go project directory.
Build a web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests.
Implement URL shortening and redirection logic.
Use a data structure to store the mapping between short and long URLs (e.g., a map or a database).
Create a simple web page where users can enter a long URL and get a shortened version.
Ensure error handling and validation for invalid URLs.
